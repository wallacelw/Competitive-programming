## Terminology:

**Clique**: a subset of vertices of an *undirected graph* such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent.

**Articulation Points ( Cut Vertices )**: *A vertex* whose remotion would split a connected component and create more *connected components*.

**Bridges ( Cut Edges )**: *An Edge* whose remotion would split a connected component and increase the number of *connected components* present. Also called *isthmus* or *cut arc*.
