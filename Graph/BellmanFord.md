## Bellman Ford
The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm1 finds shortest paths from a starting node to all nodes of the graph. The algorithm can process all kinds of graphs, provided that the graph does not contain a cycle with negative length. If the graph contains a negative cycle, the algorithm can detect this. To find it, run onde more time.

```cpp

for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) distance[i] = INF;
    distance[x] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n-1; i++) {
        for (auto e : edges) {
            int a, b, w;
            tie(a, b, w) = e;
            distance[b] = min(distance[b], distance[a]+w);
        }
}
