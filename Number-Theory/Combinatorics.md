## Combinatorics

### Stars and Bars 

Also called "sticks and stones", "balls and bars", and "dots and dividers"

$ x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = m $

**Example: (n = 3, m = 7)**

★ ★ ★ ★ | ★ | ★ ★

*n* Groups;
*n-1* Bars;
*m* Stars;

**Solution**

*C(n+m-1, n-1) = (n+m-1)! / ( (n-1)! (m)! )*

**Proof**

Elements = Bars + Stars = (n-1) + m = n+m-1;
Repetition of Bars = n-1
Repetition of Stars = m

Therefore, it's a simple *permutation with repetition*.

$ P^{(n+m-1)}_{(n-1,m)} = C (n+m-1, m)$
