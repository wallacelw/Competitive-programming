\section{Sieves}

    These sieves are used to find all primes up to an upper bound N, which is usually $10^7$

    \subsection{Linear Sieve}

    We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values
    $lp[]$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. 
    Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for
    $O(n)$.

    Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:
    $$i = lp [i] \cdot x,$$
    where 
    $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of 
    $i$, and the number 
    $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than 
    $lp [i]$, i.e.
    $$lp [i] \le lp [x].$$
    Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every 
    $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to 
    $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.

    Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values 
    $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.
