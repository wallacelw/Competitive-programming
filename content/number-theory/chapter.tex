\section{Sieves}

    These sieves are used to find all primes up to an upper bound N, which is usually $10^7$

    \subsection{Eratosthenes}

        Eratosthenes uses less memory than the linear sieve and is almost as fast

    \subsection{Linear Sieve}

        Due to the lp vector, one can compute the factorization of any number very quickly!

        Can check primality with $lp[i] == i$

        Uses more memory, because lp is a vector of int or ll and not bits.

        \textbf{Proof of time complexity:}

        We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values
        $lp[]$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. 
        Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for
        $O(n)$.

        Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:
        $$i = lp [i] \cdot x,$$
        where 
        $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of 
        $i$, and the number 
        $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than 
        $lp [i]$, i.e.
        $$lp [i] \le lp [x].$$
        Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every 
        $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to 
        $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.

        Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values 
        $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.

\section{Extended Euclid}

    Solves the $ ax + by = gcd(a, b)$ equation.

    \subsection{Inverse Multiplicative}

    if \textbf{ $gcd(a, b) = 1$ }:

    then:

    $$ax + by \equiv 1$$

    also, if you apply $\pmod{b}$ to the equation:

    $$ ax \pmod{b} + by \pmod{b} \equiv 1 \pmod{b} $$
    $$ ax \equiv 1 \pmod{b} $$

    In other words, one can find the inverse multiplicative of any number $a$ in modulo $b$ if $gcd(a, b) = 1$

    \subsection{Diofantine Equation}

    $$ ax \equiv c \pmod{b} $$

    if $g = gcd({a, b, c}) \neq 1$, divide everything by $g$.

    After this, if $gcd(a, b) = 1$, find $a^{-1}$, then multiply both sides of the Diofantine equation.

    $$ x \equiv c * a^{-1} \pmod{b} $$

    After this, one has simply found $x$
