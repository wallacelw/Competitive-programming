	\subsection{2-SAT}
	
		SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) is NP-Complete.
		2-SAT is a restriction of the SAT problem, in 2-SAT every clause has exactly two variables.
		Every restriction or implication are represented in the graph as directed edges.
		The algorithm uses kosaraju to check if any (X and !X) are in the same Strongly Connected Component 
		(which implies that the problem is impossible). 
		If it doesn't, there is at least one solution, which can be generated using the topological sort of the same kosaraju 
		(opting for the variables that appers latter in the sorted order)
