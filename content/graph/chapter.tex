\section{Network flow}

	In optimization theory, maximum flow problems involve finding a 
	feasible flow through a flow network that obtains the maximum possible flow rate. 

	\kactlimport{dinic.cpp}

	\subsection{Minimum Cut}

	In computer science and optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, 
	the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the total weight of the edges 
	in a minimum cut, i.e., the smallest total weight of the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink. 

	Let’s define an s-t cut C = (S-component, T-component) as a partition of V $\in$ G such that 
	source s $\in$ S-component and sink t $\in$ T-component. Let’s also define a cut-set of C to be the set 
	{(u, v) $\in$ E | u $\in$ S-component, v $\in$ T-component} such that if all edges in the cut-set of C are removed,
	the Max Flow from s to t is 0 (i.e., s and t are disconnected). The cost of an s-t cut C is defined by the sum
	of the capacities of the edges in the cut-set of C.

	The by-product of computing Max Flow is Min Cut! After Max Flow algorithm stops, we run graph traversal (DFS/BFS)
	from source s again. All reachable vertices from source s using positive weighted edges in the residual graph belong
	to the S-component. All other unreachable vertices belong to the T-component. All edges connecting the S-component to
	the T-component belong to the cut-set of C. The Min Cut value is equal to the Max Flow value.
	This is the minimum over all possible s-t cuts values.

	\subsection{Matching with Flow}

	By modeling a bipartite graph, with some Vertices (that will choose a match) to be on the L graph and some Vertices (that will be chosen) on the R.
	Set the correct capacities for these edges and also for the edges that connects the sink and source. After this modeling
	and running the dinic max flow algorithm, one will generate a possible matching (if it is possible).

	A special case of matching is the perfect matching, which includes all vertices from the bipartite graph L and R.

	A maximum matching has the maximum cadinality. A perfect matching is a maximum matching. 
	But the opposite is not necessarity true.

	It's possible to access dinic.edges, which is a vector that contains all edges and also its respective attributes, 
	like the \textit{flow} passing through each edge. Remember to consider that negative flow exist for reverse edges.

\section{Undirected Graph}

	Bridges and Articulation Points are concepts for undirected graphs!
	
	\subsection{Bridges (Cut Edges)}

		Also called \textbf{isthmus} or \textbf{cut arc}.
		
		A back-edge is never a bridge!
		
		A \textbf{lowlink} for a vertice $U$ is the closest vertice to the root reachable using only span edges and a \textit{single} back-edge, starting in the subtree of $U$.
		
		After constructing a DFS Tree, an edge (u, v) is a bridge $\iff$ there is no back-edge from $v$ (or a descendent of $v$) to $u$ (or an ancestor of $u$)
		
		To do this efficiently, it's used $tin[i]$ (entry time of node $i$) and $low[i]$ (minimum entry time considering all nodes that can be reached from node $i$).
		
		In another words, a edge (u, v) is a bridge $\iff$ the low[v] > tin[u].

		\kactlimport{bridges.cpp}

	\subsection{Bridge Tree}

	After merging \textit{vertices} of a \textbf{2-edge connected component} into single vertices, and leaving only bridges, one can generate a Bridge Tree.

	Every \textbf{2-edge connected component} has following properties:

    \begin{itemize}
		\item For each pair of vertices {A, B} inside the same component, there are at least 2 distinct paths from A to B (which may repeat vertices).
	\end{itemize}

	\kactlimport{bridgeTree.cpp}
	
	\subsection{Articulation Points} 

	One Vertice in a graph is considered a Articulation Points or Cut Vertice if its removal in the graph will generate more disconnected components

	\kactlimport{articulation.cpp}

	\subsection{Block Cut Tree}

	After merging \textit{edges} of a \textbf{2-vertex connected component} into single vertices, one can obtain a block cut tree.

	2-vertex connected components are also called as biconnected component
	
	Every bridge by itself is a biconnected component

	Each edge in the block-cut tree connects exactly an Articulation Point and a biconnected component (bipartite graph)

	Each biconnected component has the following properties:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item For each pair of edges, there is a cycle that contains both edges
		\item For each pair of vertices {A, B} inside the same connected component, there are at least 2 distinct paths from A to B (which do not repeat vertices).
	\end{itemize}

	\kactlimport{blockCutTree.cpp}
	
	\subsection{Minimum Spanning Tree}

	A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges
	of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together,
	without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
	That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

	\kactlimport{kruskal.cpp}

	\section{Directed Graph}

	\subsection{Topological Sort}

	Sort a directed graph with no cycles (DAG) in an order which each source of an edge is visited before the sink of this edge.

	Cannot have cycles, because it would create a contradition of which vertices whould come before.

	It can be done with a DFS, appending in the reverse order of transversal. Also a stack can be used to reverse order	

	\kactlimport{toposort.cpp}

	\subsection{Kosaraju}

	A Strongly Connected Component is a maximal subgraph in which every vertex is reachable
	from any vertex inside this same subgraph.

	A important \textit{property} is that the inverted graph or transposed graph has the same SCCs
	as the original graph.

	\kactlimport{kosaraju.cpp}

	\subsection{2-SAT}
	
		SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) is NP-Complete.

		2-SAT is a restriction of the SAT problem, in 2-SAT every clause has exactly two variables:
		$ (X_1 \vee X_2) \wedge (X_2 \vee X_3) $

		Every restriction or implication are represented in the graph as directed edges.

		The algorithm uses kosaraju to check if any ($X$ and $\neg{X}$) are in the same Strongly Connected Component 
		(which implies that the problem is impossible). 

		If it doesn't, there is at least one solution, which can be generated using the topological sort of the same kosaraju 
		(opting for the variables that appers latter in the sorted order)
