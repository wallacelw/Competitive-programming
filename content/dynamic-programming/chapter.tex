\section{Convex Hull Trick}

    If multiple transitions of the DP can be seen as 
    first degree polynomials (lines). CHT can be used to optimized it

    Some valid functions:

    $ax + b$
    
    $cx^2 + ax + b$ 
    (ignore $cx^2$ if c is independent)

\section{Li-chao Tree}

    Works for any type of function that has the \textbf{transcending property}:

    Given two functions f(x),g(x) of that type, 
    if f(t) is greater than/smaller than g(t) for some x=t,
    then f(x) will be greater than/smaller than g(x) for x>t.
    In other words, once f(x) “win/lose” g(x), f(x) will continue to “win/lose” g(x).

    The most common one is the line function: $ ax + b $
